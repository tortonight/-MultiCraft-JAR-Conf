 MC 1.18 + Java change AGAIN (November-2021 Update)
-----

MC 1.18 > 1.18.1 > 1.18 are now using JAVA 17 (from Zulu since AdoptOpenJDK ceased activity and Adoptium is doing nothing to be user friendly)

[start]
command = "{JAVA}" -Xmx{MAX_MEMORY}M -Xms{START_MEMORY}M -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal -jar "{JAR}" nogui {PARAMS}

Vanilla 1.18 is now available too.

-----
üÜï New release v0.1-beta-final (End-September 2021)
-----

In order to prepare a new organization, it seemed important to create a milestone of the last 4 years evolutions.
Things will change a lot till the next release.

-----
‚ö†Ô∏è Java change AGAIN (June-2021 Update)
-----

Mojang decided to unilaterally move from JAVA 11 > JAVA 16 (yup a jump of 5 versions and the use of a no LTS, ...).     
Since Vanilla 1.17, there is the need to use a new JVM so for now this repo isn't natively compatible with 1.17 (as the 8th of June).

## NOT READY FOR Vanilla 1.18 " YET " !!!!

Temporary use of a JAVA NO LTS version : "{JAVA}" for the Vanilla 1.18 profile already available.
